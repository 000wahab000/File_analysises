You validated user input safely
You separated files vs folders correctly.
You used the same logic pattern twice instead of inventing a new one.
You confirmed folder traversal works without recursion yet.
You proved getsize + join + loop works when used on the right thing.
This is the backbone of disk analysis tools. No joke.
